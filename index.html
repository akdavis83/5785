      <h3 style="text-align: center; color: white;"><img src="hey.gif" style="width: 50px;"> 5785, better known as 2025 could be the tipping point year for breakthrough upon breakthrough. Ruach or Nephesh? Spirit or Flesh?? 25=Chamesh in Hebrew, means: power, strength, alertness(wake-up!), Torah, grace, ministry, service, gospel, fruitfulness, going forth, fast movement, anointed, prayers, and protection. 5x5=25 and that is grace upon grace. 20=redemption and 5=grace multiplied. What does that mean for my life practically? This is a time to be prepared for promotion with 5 smooth stones for Goliath. This is a time to be a smooth living stone with your everyday life by letting the water of the word refine the edges. This is a time to be made a thousand times as you are (Deu 1:11) like the 5 loaves that Jesus broke to feed 5,000. The Fifth Spirit of God is power and strength and in this year of times 5 you are equipped with 5 times the provision to get the job done. This grace is to take the gospel message out and plant the seed of the word in hearts ready to hear and receive. Hey(5) means breath, air, spirit and to behold(make known). Breathe in the atmosphere of heaven. Soak in the anointing of God like the kids in Azusa street used to do underneath the church pews. The anointing oil was made of 5 ingredients, 4 spices mixed with olive oil and in this season we are to stay vitally connected to the true Branch as a wild olive grafted in. The consequences are dire. If we are not ruled by the Spirit of God we will be ruled by the flesh. A fleshly dominated person is on the way towards becoming a demonically ruled person and a person in the flesh is worse than a demon possessed person. A person in the flesh can act any way they choose or feel at the moment and blame it on something else. When demon possessed people ran to Jesus they stopped, got delivered and were set free. The people who went to Jesus in their flesh, chose to reject Him and ended up worse than the ones who were really under demonic control. The negative consequences of 5 is feet running swiftly to evil, walking towards darkness instead of away from it, and being ruled by the power of the Nephesh/flesh instead of the power of the Spirit. We need restraint in our minds, in our hearts, in our flesh, attitudes, emotions and actions now more than ever. We need to open up our hearts and lives to the power of the Holy Ghost and let the Lord Jesus Christ rule and reign supreme, our future depends upon it. This can only be done with unity, love, and maturity. Without love there is no unity, and without unity there is no power, and without power we are helpless and powerless to make the necessary positive changes that are needed. How can a divided body bring unity to places where division reigns? It cannot. Let us not let the light of the gospel go out, let us shine and reflect the light of Christ to the world in need of Him!</h3>
